# About me

This is a personal blog where I write about my experiences in the Society for Creative Anachronism.

Links to me elsewhere: My Order of Precedence entry is [here](http://wimble.outlandsheralds.org/individual_record.php?PersonID=11750). My East Kingdom Wiki page is [here](https://wiki.eastkingdom.org/index.php?title=Anne_of_%C3%98stgar%C3%B0r).


## Introduction

I am currently active in the Barony of Caerthe, in the Kingdom of the Outlands (Denver, CO). I previously lived in the Crown Province of Østgarðr, in the East Kingdom (New York City, NY), and was active there at the beginning of my SCA practice, from spring 2017 to summer 2021. 

I enjoy rapier fencing and regularly attend local practice where I am. I am authorized in single sword (first authorized in 2017-09), all secondary objects (dagger 2018-05, all others 2021-08), spear (2022-07), and cut and thrust for both 1 and 2 handed (2023-12). I am also a Rapier Field Marshal in the Outlands for both standard heavy rapier (2023-05) and cut and thrust (2023-12), where we distinguish between field and authorizing marshals. 

Another interest I am enthusiastic about is kumihimo, historic Japanese silk cord braiding, which I have been practicing (mostly with more easily accessible modern materials) since 2019.

'''Please note''', my pronouns are they/them/theirs, and I prefer gender-neutral forms of address (Noble is currently my preferred title, now that I have an AoA). 

(You may also have met me in the Barony of Thescorre, Kingdom of Æthelmearc (Rochester, NY) circa 2012, when I was in my freshman year of college and attended a few events, or elsewhere in the East Kingdom, where I grew up.)

## In Case of Court

I'd prefer advance notice if I am to appear in Court, though it's not strictly required. My partner Lady Aífe an tSneachta can be contacted if you don't want to contact me directly, and/or my doña, Doña Mizuno Kiku Ibara. 

## Persona

A caveat: Very much still in progress, and not currently focusing deeply on this.

My current persona is later Roman (around the fall of Rome). I often wear Roman garb due to the ease of construction - I am almost always wearing something either bright green or Roman. I am also curious about a just slightly later time period in southern Italian city-states, e.g. Amalfi, but I've found it much harder to find information about pre-Renaissance city-states in what is now Italy, and much easier to find Roman inspiration :)
