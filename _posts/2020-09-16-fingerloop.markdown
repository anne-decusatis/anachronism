## Fingerloop braiding

I learned at a local online workshop last weekend how to make this braid: <https://fingerloop.org/patterns.html#n02>

It looks like five bowes of 48" of unlooped string each produces about 15" of cord. Unfortunately I was aiming for 20" minimum. 60" was better for that use. 

The kumihimo cord, center of three cords, (from sometime last year, I think made on my cardboard disk) is only a little more thick than the fingerloop cords on either side, but it feels much more solid and dense. Probably because of the higher tension I pull the bobbins with on the disk.
I wonder if it would be possible to make thin, bendy kumihimo by doing it on a marudai with less weight, or not pulling as hard?
