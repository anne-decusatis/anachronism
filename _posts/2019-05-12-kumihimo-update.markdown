## Notes on threads

I'm traveling soon and wanted a big project that fit in a small space for the 8 hours each way on the plane. So, based on some random guessing, I ordered a 64-slot disk, 32 bobbins, and some 10/2 Valley Cotton: one pound each of mosstone green, white, and black.

It turns out that 10/2 Cotton is maybe half as thick as the embroidery floss I'd been using, which is around the thinnest of fibers that I think would work for kumihimo. It's fine though, it was on sale and, as it turns out, I expect this to be about a lifetime supply. My partner helpfully pointed out that each pound of yarn is about four kilometers of yarn. 

I'm not sure, is 10/2 cotton yarn or string? 

## First project with 10/2 Cotton

I decided to start with a simple green and white braid on my small pocket disk. Here I learned a valuable lesson, which I will put in a new paragraph, as it's that important: 

Wind the bobbins as you cut the thread, don't cut a long thread and plan to wind later.

I valiantly tried to detangle it, for maybe half an hour...

Then I was like, "wait a minute, I have four kilometers of yarn, this is not even going to make a dent in it," and cut new yarn. I'm currently keeping the tangled yarn in my yarn box, as a reminder.

Also note that the green was a bit thin on first unwinding, and broke if I pulled on it too hard. It seems to be more stable now that I've worked my way in, though. 

## The big project

I'm going to make a belt with a pattern similar to my arms*! Or at least, I'm going to try. 

_*This was my device the last time I wrote about it :)_

The 64 slot disk is thicker foam than the 32, and as a reminder, the pattern was crafted on [Craft Design Online](https://craftdesignonline.com/kumihimo/kongoh-gumi-friendship-bracelets/).

I'm excited to see how this turns out.
