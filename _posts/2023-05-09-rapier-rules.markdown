## Differences Between Outlands and Society Rapier Rulesets

When studying for my upcoming field marshal test, I read both the Kingdom and Society level rapier handbook documents. They are quite similar and there is no way to easily tell which rules are society level and which are local without reading two very similarly formatted documents and comparing page by page. Until now, where I've done it for you in this blog post!

## Sources

This post is a detailed, line-level comparison of <https://www.outlands.org/images/kingdom-library/outalnds-activity-rulebooks/Outlands_Rapier_2021_Final.pdf> and <https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FencingMarshalsHandbookApril2020.pdf>.


## Too long; didn't read
Before we get into the details: my recommendation is to only read the Outlands handbook if you're in the Outlands. It contains all the Society level info; there is no case in which the Society handbook has something the Outlands handbook does not* and many cases where the reverse is true and the Outlands handbook has something useful that isn't at Society level.

* the Torso definition in the glossary and a reference picture for parts of the body was omitted from the Outlands handbook, presumably accidentally? It's pretty clear from context though.


## Detailed walkthrough


### Section 1: Introduction

The Society manual contains a foreword by the then Society Rapier Marshal, then a diff from the current manual edition and the prior manual edition, then a table of contents, then sections 1.1-1.6.

The Outlands manual contains a table of contents, then an introduction with a couple paragraphs lifted from the Society manual and some new ones, then sections 1.1-1.6.

Note that sections 1.1-1.6 differ between the two manuals. Both broadly cover the scope of the rules and other relevant rulesets. Sections 1.4 and 1.6 are the same between the two manuals.

The Society manual covers in 1.1-1.3:

1.1 These rules set fundamental standards for Fencing Combat in the SCA. They are
designed to allow use by the Kingdoms of the Society as basic rules.
1.2. In keeping with Corpora, Kingdoms retain the right to add rules which establish more
restrictive standards.
1.3. All combatants and marshals are responsible for knowing these rules, as well as the
additional rules of their Kingdom.

and the Outlands manual covers in 1.1-1.3:

1.1 The current Society rules are the core of rapier in the SCA and are published in the SCA Fencing Marshals’ Handbook,
April 2020, at http://sca.org/officers/marshal/combat/rapier/ All rapier fighters will be expected to know and conform
to these rules.
1.2. The Society Rules of the List are published in section IX.B of the Governing Documents of SCA, Inc (The Society for
Creative Anachronism, Inc. Organizational Handbook, August 17, 2015) at www.SCA.org/docs/pdf/govdocs.pdf
1.3. Any rules presented here are in addition to those rules and wherever a conflict appears to exist, the more stringent of
the two must apply.

Section 1.5 in the Society manual is moved to the foreword in the Outlands manual. Section 1.5 in the Outlands manual instead reads "These rules are copied from the SCA Fencing Marshals’ Handbook, April 2020, with clarifications and minor modifications."

### Section 2: General Information

In 2.1, different text but same concept. Society says that you must follow these rules but kingdoms can be more restrictive. Outlands says that you have to follow Society and Outlands rules.

In 2.2, different text but same concept. Society says that fencing requires its own authorization process. Outlands says that same wording, and adds that the authorization process is defined in Appendix 5.

In 2.3, no change.

In 2.4, Society says that interkingdom events are defined by the host kingdom conventions. Outlands says that for events hosted in the Outlands we follow Outlands standards for weapons and Society standards for armor.

In 2.5, Society covers the chain of command from Society level to Kingdom level and then says deputies are per-kingdom. Outlands covers the chain of command within the kingdom.

In 2.6, there is a divergence. Outlands rules cover diving for a weapon in 2.6 and youth in 2.7 and 2.7.1. In Society rules 2.6 and 2.7 both cover youth combatants. 

Outlands section 2.6 (from what I've heard, thank you Doña Lucrezia!):

In single combat, as long as one offensive weapon is retained, a fighter is considered armed. When disarmed (holding no
offensive weapon) the combatant must yield and accept a safe, honorable loss unless their opponent allows them to recover
their closest weapon. Diving or scrambling for a weapon is unsafe and is specifically prohibited.

The actual content of the rules on youth is the same between the rulesets, with slightly differing wording.

Section 2.8 covers the rules of the list, both appear to be broadly taken from the armored combat conventions. Interestingly, there are 15 subsections in the Outlands manual and 9 in the Society manual. 2.8.1 and 2.8.2 are the same between the manuals.

2.8.3 is exclusive to the Outlands:

Unauthorized rapier fighters may train with, and under the supervision of, authorized rapier fighters in order to
prepare for authorization. However, the unauthorized fencer must satisfy current Kingdom requirements for
participation in combat. This requirement is satisfied either by being a member of the SCA, Inc., or, if not a
member, by signing the liability waiver at each official practice or event.

2.8.4 Outlands matches 2.8.3 Society, etc, until 2.8.11 onwards which are net new to the Outlands:

2.8.11 There shall be at least two Marshals on the field for a tournament or duel, and at least one for any other combat.
There shall be one marshal for every ten combatants in a melee, with a minimum of two Marshals.
2.8.12 Combatants may engage only when the rapier field Marshal has received verbal acknowledgment of readiness
from each combatant and has instructed them to begin.
2.8.13 The Marshals shall use terms such as "matte" or “edge of the world” to warn the combatants if they are approaching
the edge of the list field. The combatants should then make an effort to avoid moving off the field.
2.8.14 At the end of each bout the Marshal shall ask each of the fighters if they are satisfied with the conduct
of the bout. Each Marshal is also asked if they have any questions. Any participants who leave the field thereby
declare themselves satisfied with the bout.
2.8.15 As previously stated, any combatant may—without dishonor or penalty—reject a bout against any
non-standard equipment or technique. The non-standard equipment or technique will then be disallowed for that
bout, and the bout will be resolved using standard equipment and techniques.

### Section 3: Conventions

The same content in 3.1 and 3.2 across both manuals. Only the Outlands manual has subsections with the following additional clarifications at the kingdom level.

3.1.1. The Authorizations from out of kingdom combatants living in the Outlands will be honored for three months;
after which the combatant is expected to re-authorize under an Outlands Authorizing Marshal.
3.1.2. Out-of-Kingdom rapier fighters must familiarize themselves with the weapons standards and other rules,
requirements, and conventions of Outlands Rapier Combat.

3.2.1. Holds are not to be called for the loss of a weapon unless that weapon may be a tripping hazard.
3.2.2. Hold should not be called for incidental gapping in abrasion resistant armor.
3.2.3. If any of the fighters have a hearing impairment, the call of hold shall be accompanied with a “X” made by the
marshal crossing their forearms up and in front of their chest.

### Section 4: Categories of Fencing

The text in bullets is all the same but buried in the table are the following important details:
* Knee rigid protection is required for C&T in the Outlands but not by Society standards
* Push cuts are NOT legal in the Outlands but may be in other kingdoms

There is also an additional footnote that spear is nonstandard in the Outlands.

### Section 5: Types of Fencing Combat

Identical except for one additional point in the Outlands manual.

5.3.6 Melee combat often involves a large variety of weapons. The Marshals may limit what weapons and secondaries
are to be used in each melee. It is the responsibility of each combatant to withdrawal from a melee if they are
uncomfortable fighting against any of the allowed weaponry.

### Section 6: Description of Weapons and Defensive Objects

6.1 identical. 6.2 identical. 6.3 - All references to metal spears, deprecated but still existent in Society handbook, removed from Outlands handbook; otherwise identical. 6.4 identical. 

6.5.4.1 exclusive to the Outlands:

"Hold" should be called if the cloak becomes tangled about either fighter or about one of the weapons such
that the weapon cannot be withdrawn with sufficient pull. “Hold" need not be called if the cloak is merely near
the face, deflecting a weapon, or loosely draped over or weighting down the blade.

6.5.6-6.5.8 are Outlands only as well:

6.5.6. In addition to the Society rules for parrying devices listed below, the device must be recognizable as a civilian
defensive item of the Period. Bucklers must obviously be a buckler or small targe, not a kite shield or heater.
Dimensions are not listed, but the general "spirit of the game" is expected to be abided.
6.5.7. A rigid parry device can be a hard scabbard, a walking stick, or a baton, but not a "defensive" weapon (ie: rigid
defensive daggers).
6.5.8. Devices made of PVC pipe must be wrapped in cloth, fiber tape, or duct tape, and one or both ends must be
capped. A scabbard with one end capped must be used in such a manner the open end is not presented to
the opponent


### Section 7: Use of Weapons and Defensive Objects

7.1 identical. 7.2 similar but 7.2.4 is outlands specific: 

Push Cuts are considered a Non-standard Technique and may only be used when agreed to before a melee,
tournament or individual bout

7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6 identical. 7.7 has the following Outlands only addition: 

7.7.3 Killing from behind may only be performed on one opponent at a time.

7.8 identical. 7.9 in the Outlands contains the additional text, not called out as a sub bullet:

Blade grasping may only be used to immobilize a blade, not bend or wrest it from an opponent's grip, nor to grapple an
opponent

7.10-7.11 identical.

### Section 8: Acknowledgement of Blows

8.1 and 8.2 identical.

8.3.3 in the Outlands: A blow to the hand or arm renders the entire limb incapacitated.
8.3.3 in Society standard: A blow to the hand renders the hand unable to hold a weapon or defensive object.
The hand may be balled into a fist and used to parry with, as a rigid extension of the
forearm.


8.3.5 has significant differences and much more detail in the Outlands handbook. The basics are still the same, knee-walking is still allowed. 

8.3.5. A valid blow to the foot or leg renders the leg as non-weight-bearing. The combatant must then fight kneeling,
sitting, or standing with their feet together. Fighters shall assume the kneeling or sitting position in a controlled
manner, and may not continue forward motion during this transition.
8.3.5.1. A combatant having received a blow to the foot or lower leg who fights from the ground may fight from and
move about on their knees. Any rising motion must be controlled; fighters shall not throw themselves forward.
8.3.5.2. A combatant having received a blow to the upper leg may move about, but may not rise up during combat.
8.3.5.3. Fighting from the knees means both knees must be on the ground (or seated). Combatants may not be up on
one foot, effectively lunging from their knees.
8.3.5.4. If the combatant chooses to continue standing with their feet together, no motion of the feet is allowed.
Fighters may not lunge, retreat, step laterally, etc. Any blows they deliver while performing said motion
will not be counted. The fighter may be given one warning for movement, after which they must sit or
kneel, or yield the bout.

The Outlands also adds 8.3.6 on calibration. 

8.3.6. It is HIGHLY recommended that unfamiliar fighters perform a set of quick calibration passes before a bout in
order to properly gauge what either opponent will consider a valid shot or draw

### Section 9: Armor Requirements

9.1-9.3 identical. 9.4 has the addition of chainmail as puncture resistant in the Outlands:

9.4.1. In addition to the equipment described in the Society Rapier Handbook, close mesh chain mail (ie: Butcher’s
Mail, Sharkmail, and other commercial brands) are considered puncture-resistant material and are acceptable
armor provided the following conditions are met:
9.4.1.1. The mail is worn underneath an abrasion resistant shirt or doublet; OR If worn on top of a shirt, the
armholes must be tied close to the arm in such a fashion as to prevent blades from sliding up the sleeve and
into the armpit, and the shirt must be made of abrasion resistant material
9.4.1.2. Care is taken to check the mail for broken or weak links, particularly under the shirt’s armpits.

Otherwise the handbooks are identical through section 9.10.

### Section 10: Marshalling

10.1 identical. 10.2.2-10.2.6 exclusive to the Outlands, otherwise 10.2 identical:

10.2.2. The term marshal generally refers to field marshals. Field Marshals act under the direction of the Marshal in
Charge upon the combat field to oversee the safety and the orderly action of combat. These Marshals are
responsible for the enforcement of the Rules of Rapier Combat and/or Cut & Thrust Combat as appropriate. It is
not required to be an authorized fencer to become an authorized fencing Marshal.
10.2.3. Authorizing Marshals are appointed by the Outlands Rapier Marshal and are charged with the responsibility of
authorizing rapier fighters for competition and Field Marshals to oversee safety and the orderly action of combat.
10.2.4. The Marshal in Charge is an authorized Rapier Field Marshal who is in charge of the rapier activities at a specific
SCA function (event, practice, or demo). This Marshal is specifically responsible for the general enforcement of
all Rules of Rapier Combat, supervision of Field Marshals, equipment inspection, and the combatant suspension
procedure. There must be a Marshal in Charge at every SCA function where there is rapier activity.
10.2.5. Group Rapier Marshals are authorized Field Marshals responsible for reporting and managing the Rapier
activities of a specific SCA Group (Barony, Shire, etc.). As an SCA officer they are required to fully understand
and enforce current SCA Rapier Policies. The Group Marshal must be or assure that there is a Marshal in Charge
at all required times.
10.2.6. The Outlands Rapier Marshal is the Marshal appointed by the Crown and the Earl Marshal to oversee rapier combat
within the kingdom and is the only Marshal who may appoint Rapier Authorizing Marshals.

This section is identical in 10.3-10.7. 10.8 is added:

10.8: More in depth information about marshaling is in Appendix 4.

### Section 11: Adverse events

Identical.

### Section 12: Use of weapons, styles, and armor requirements outside of these rules

Identical. Section 12.3 should probably be removed from the Outlands rules!

12.3 The separate Kingdoms retain the right to maintain a ruleset which establishes more restrictive standards than those
defined here. Any weapons, armor, or other techniques outside a Kingdom’s ruleset but within those of the Society as
described here, must be run as an experiment under the approval of the KRM and the Kingdom Earl Marshal.

### Appendix 1: Glossary

The following term is exclusive to the Outlands:

Fleeting Contact: Light, brief, accidental contact between combatants. Any attempts to hold, push, control, grapple, etc under the
guise of fleeting contact will not be tolerated

The following term is in the Society standard but not the Outlands:
Torso: The torso includes includes the chest, abdomen, back, and the regions on the inner part of
the upper arm extending 4” down from the armpit.

Also this image is not in the Outlands handbook:
Figure A1.4. Regions of the body,
relevant to acknowledging valid
blows.

Otherwise the content is identical.

### Appendix 2: Inspecting a combatant’s arms and armor

A.2.1.4 sub-point on metal spears removed from Outlands handbook. Otherwise identical.

### Appendix 3: Testing methods for penetration resistant armor

I have to admit I skimmed this but I am pretty sure it is identical and consists only of the procedure for creating and using a drop tester.

### Appendix 4: Marshalling Fencing in the SCA

A4.1 has the following additional clarifications in the Outlands, since the concept of a "field marshal" as opposed to "authorizing marshal" is Outlands specific:

A.4.1.1 Fencing field marshals act under the direction of the Marshal in Charge upon the combat field to oversee the safety and
orderly action of combat. These Marshals are responsible for the enforcement of the Rules of Rapier Combat. It is not required to
be an authorized fencer to become an authorized fencing Marshal. Fencing field marshals must be able to officiate all forms of
light rapier and rapier.
A.4.1.2 Cut and Thrust Field Marshals have the same essential requirements and job duties as a Fencing Field Marshal. They are
expected to know Society and Outlands Cut and Thrust rules and the Rules of the List thoroughly, and be willing and able to
enforce those rules. Everything else is the same, from working under the Marshal in Charge and list field protocol to post bout
confirmations of satisfaction. As with Fencing Marshals, it is not required that Cut and Thrust Field Marshals be authorized as
Cut and Thrust fighters. Fencing field marshals must be able to officiate all forms of Cut and Thrust.

Sections A4.6 and A4.7 are new and cover field marshalling in the Outlands. I have not reproduced them in full here but I recommend they are read in full, they're on page 26-30 of the PDF.

In the Society handbook, A4.5 is immediately followed by tournament conventions and marshalling conventions. In the Outlands handbook, similar content is covered much more thoroughly in A4.8 (single combat tournaments), A4.9 (melee), and A4.10 (warnings/suspensions).

A4.11 in the Outlands covers what is needed to be a Marshal in Charge of any SCA event/practice/other official function. It begins page 30. Note:

There must be a Marshal in
Charge at every SCA function where there is rapier activity, and the Marshal in Charge should be present during every
tournament held at an event. The duties for being a Marshal in Charge are the same for both Fencing and Cut and Thrust.
The autocrat of a particular event usually chooses a Marshal in Charge for their event. If the autocrat does not do so, the Local
Marshal is the de facto Marshal in Charge unless another Marshal steps forward to do the job. In the case of fighter practice the
Group Marshal is the default Marshal in Charge unless they have designated someone else.

A4.12 covers similar territory for a Group Marshal, and A4.13 for an Authorizing Marshal in the Outlands (though it mostly just says to ask the KRM to be an authorizing marshal). A4.14 covers what is needed to be the Kingdom Rapier Marshal, and A4.15 regional deputies of the KRM (ask your KRM on that as well). Some fun bits:

Group Rapier Marshals are authorized Field Marshals responsible for reporting and managing the rapier activities of a specific
SCA Group (Barony, Shire, etc.) As an SCA officer they are required to fully understand and enforce current SCA Rapier
Policies. The Group Marshal must be or assure that there is a Marshal in Charge at all required times.
Like any other group officer the Local Marshal for a group must reside in the recognized boundaries of the area that they serve.

The Outlands Rapier Marshal is the marshal appointed by the Crown and the Earl Marshal to oversee rapier combat within the
Kingdom and is the only Marshal who may appoint Rapier Authorization Marshals.

To avoid the appearance of impropriety it is recommended that the KRM not participate as a combatant in tournaments
while in office.

### Appendix 5: Authorization

Exclusive to the Outlands:

Only persons who are current members of the Society
for Creative Anachronism are authorized or are allowed to be authorized to participate in combat activities within the Kingdom
of the Outlands.

A5.2: Society level doesn't say much aside from that it delegates this to kingdoms. The Outlands says:

A5.2. The Outlands has three major fencing categories, outlined in Section 4 Categories of Fencing. Each category requires a
separate authorization. The base authorization for each category will include one single sword. Each additional weapon or
secondary within that category can be included in the authorization.
● For example: a fighter may be authorized “full card” in light rapier, which includes single sword, case of swords, dagger,
and defensive object. The same fighter may also be authorized in rapier, single sword and spear only. This fighter may
not enter a tournament and fight with a rapier and buckler; they would need to add defensive object to their rapier
authorization first.

A5.3.7 contains the additional context in the Outlands:
The authorizing
marshal is encouraged to bend and break the rules of SCA combat to test this. Great care must be taken to not cause
injury during this test.

A5.5-A5.7 are exclusive to the Outlands:

A5.5. Fencing authorizations are valid for up to two years. Shorter durations are acceptable but no day authorizations shall be
issued—a fighter is to be considered safe or not.

A5.6 All authorizations require:
● The combatant must pass a verbal test of knowledge about the equipment specifications and Rapier Marshallate rules of
the Outlands.
● The combatant must pass a field test using the appropriate equipment before an authorization is issued (though it is not
required that the combatant own their own equipment). This includes fighting with their non-dominant hand and while
legged.
● The combatant must display knowledge of melee conventions to participate in melee safely. The combatant must pass
verbal test indicating knowledge of the following:
o Safely performing a death from behind
o Legal blows to the 180 and 120
o Use of local holds
o Common phrases to avoid to minimize unnecessary calls of “hold”. For example, hole sounds like hold.
Phrases like “Fill the gap in the line” should be used instead of “Fill the hole”; and “There is a divot in the
ground” instead of “Mind the hole over there”.
● The Authorizing Marshal must answer the following question in the negative: "Is this fencer a danger to themself or
to others?"

A5.7 The Authorizing Marshal shall issue or update authorization cards for those that pass the authorization test and shall report
as per the Outlands Rapier Marshal’s requirements. A candidate who fails the test may be given additional training and may
apply for authorization at another time. The combatant must inform the marshal conducting the second authorization of their
failure to pass if the test was within the preceding 6 months. The candidate who passes the tests will be duly authorized to
complete in official rapier competitions


### Appendix 6: Procedure for experimental programs

Identical. Reference for the KRM but I'm not convinced we need this in the Outlands rules, it's for KRM use only.

### Appendix 7: Adverse Events Reports

Identical. More useful than Appendix 6.

### Appendix 8: Forms

Outlands specific. Half a page with links to the Outlands website for PDFs. The PDFs are not reproduced, just the links.

### Approval signatures for Outlands

This was approved and signed by crown, KRM, and KEM (armored combat earl marshal).
