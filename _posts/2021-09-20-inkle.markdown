## Some garb pics

I made matching green linen cotes for Isabel and I (and a black surcote for her) following patterns based on The Medieval Tailor's Assistant. I finished them just in time for East Kingdom 12th Night in January 2020.... 

We wore them to Newcomer's Faire in the Barony of Unser Hafen (in our new home in the Outlands) and I managed to take just a couple pictures in the daylight before the carpool arrived.

## Inkle loom

I decided a while back that I was going to get into weaving, when I accidentally bought all that 10/2 cotton that I didn't like using for kumihimo. I tried some other things, but now that I have a spacious apartment and a car, I decided that there was no need to break my back over and over trying to wind tablet weaving around chairs to warp it, and then tying it to random things in the apartment to attempt to tension it. Also I saw someone with an inkle loom at Caerthe Investiture, and it seemed like they were having a great time, and they showed me how it worked and let me weave a few rows, and it was fun!

So I bought an inkle loom of my own at the start of September!

The Ashford loom I have has some assembly required, once the glue was dry it also had very clear instructions in the accompanying booklet on how to warp it, weave, and finish the weaving. So I won't go into detail on that. I was very gratified when an SCA friend from back in Ostgardr visited us in Caerthe, saw the loom in my apartment, and complimented the edges of the weaving. 

Here's some gratuitous pictures:
