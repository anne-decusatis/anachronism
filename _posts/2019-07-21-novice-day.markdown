## What is Novice Day? What did I do there?

[East Kingdom Novice Day](https://www.eastkingdom.org/EventDetails.php?eid=3455) is an annual event focused on newcomers to the SCA. They host several competitions and classes for people who are either completely new, or interested in learning a new skill. It was a bit scarcely attended, due to the excessive heat warning. I got to try so many things!

* I entered the Novice Rapier Tourney (this was my last year of eligibility - it's open to people who have authorized within two years), where I had fun despite the heat index reaching, at one point in the tourney, 103+ degrees Fahrenheit. I didn't win many bouts but that doesn't really matter to me. I was in a runoff competition for "best death," but I wasn't committed enough to dying to win.
* I joined my partner (who is completely new - this was her fourth(?) event!) for a last-minute bardic choral performance. We placed fourth. She wants to do more bardic performances, and keeps asking me questions about it that I don't know how to answer. Luckily I know several bards. 
* I entered my kumihimo projects, with some documentation, in the Arts and Sciences competition. I won "best documentation" and received an incredible scroll. 

## Kumihimo

A PDF of my documentation can be found [here]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/novice-day/kumihimo.pdf).
